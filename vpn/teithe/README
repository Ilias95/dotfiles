You should use a vpn client, such as openvpn, to connect to this vpn network.

In case of openvpn, just run `openvpn tux-full-udp.ovpn` as root.
I also provide a `teithevpn` alias along with these dotfiles.

You must edit the login.conf file first and fill in your username and password.

If you wish to enter your credentials each time that you try to connect, just
change the `auth-user-pass login.conf` line in tux-full-udp.ovpn to plain
`auth-user-pass`.

Don't forget that for granting access to this network, you should accept the
relevant policy first: https://hydra.it.teithe.gr/nms/policy.php?serviceid=vpn
