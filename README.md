## About

This repository contains my personal configuration files for things like vim, zsh, etc.

Feel free to do anything with them, but use at your own "risk".

## Installation

Along with the config files I provide a few installation scripts. Again use at on your own responsibility or just read them, they are very short.

If you want to install everything you can run `./install.sh` in the top-level directory. The installer will ask you for which "modules" you wish to apply the configuration files.

Each configuration module contains its own install script, which can also be executed from its own directory. IE you can install only the vim configuration file and ignore everything else if you wish.

## Updates

Just do a `git pull` whenever you wish to get the last changes from upstream.

You might potentially need to run the installer again in order to install any new files.
