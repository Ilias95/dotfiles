My vimrc uses Vundle plugin management system to have a well organized vim
directory. Vundle also ensures that the latest versions of your plugins are
installed and makes it easy to keep them up to date.


Plugins:

Name                   Description
-------                ------------
neocomplcache          amazing autocomplete plugin
snipmate               code snippets completion
tagbar                 easily navigation via files tags
nerdtree               file explorer
vim-nerdtree-tabs      nerdtree, independent of tabs
undotree               undo history graph
nerdcommenter          code comments wrangle
vim-autoclose          autoclose brackets, parens, quotes, etc


Notes:

snipmate_remap
---------------
Neocomplcache and snipmate plugins are not compatible by default because
both are using tab key for completion. I wrote a simple script called
snipmate_remap.py for remapping snipmate's trigger key in order the two
plugins to be able to work together. By default it sets '*'to be the new
trigger key. You can set it to what you wish by editing the script directly.
Each time you update your snipmate installation (by running :BundleUpdate
if you use Vundle) you should run snipmate_remap as well.
