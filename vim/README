My vimrc uses Vundle plugin management system to have a well organized vim
directory. Vundle also ensures that the latest versions of your plugins are
installed and makes it easy to keep them up to date.

Quick vundle start:

Vim command       Description
------------      ------------
:PluginInstall    install new plugins
:PluginUpdate     update all plugins
:PluginClean      remove unused plugins

Vundle homepage: https://github.com/gmarik/vundle

Plugins used:

Name                   Description
-------                ------------
neocomplcache          autocompletion
snipmate               code snippets completion
tagbar                 navigation via file tags
nerdtree               file explorer
undotree               undo history graph
nerdcommenter          code comments wrangle
vim-autoclose          autoclose brackets, parens, quotes, etc
vim-colors-solarized   the solarized colorscheme for gvim

Notes:

snipmate_remap.py
------------------
Neocomplcache and snipmate plugins are not compatible by default because
both are using the tab key for completion. I wrote a simple script called
snipmate_remap.py which remaps snipmate's trigger key, in order the two
plugins to be able to work together. By default it sets '*' as the new
trigger key. You can set it to what you wish by editing the script directly.
Each time you update your snipmate installation you should run snipmate_remap
as well.
