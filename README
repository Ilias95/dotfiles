My personal configuration files about vim, zsh, git and vpn.

Some of these files are probably more suitable for Linux.

Installation
-------------
To run the automatic install.sh script you need to have git already installed.
Just run ./install.sh in the top-level directory.

There are different installation scripts for each configuration bundle so you
can edit the top install.sh script and select only the pieces you wish to install.

Update
-------
For now, you can do a `git pull` to get the last changes from upstream.
